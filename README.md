### Project Description
This project is a fun, prank-style web application that mimics a voice listening and processing tool but instead plays random preloaded audio clips to amuse or prank the user. The interface features a polished, visually stunning design with an animated gradient background and glassmorphic UI elements for a futuristic, professional look.

Users interact with a single button labeled "Start Listening" which activates the microphone and displays a lively, animated volume meter to simulate real-time listening. When the user presses the button again to stop listening, the app simulates processing with a brief delay and then randomly plays one of four preloaded prank audio clips (such as dog barks or funny sounds).

If audio is playing and the user presses the button to start listening again, the audio stops immediately, and the mic reactivates, allowing seamless toggling between listening and playback states.

The project‚Äôs responsive design ensures usability across devices, and the neon glowing button, animated status text with dynamic dots, and color-rich animated backgrounds all contribute to an engaging, immersive user experience.

This project demonstrates proficient use of modern web technologies including the Web Audio API for live audio handling, multimedia playback control, and advanced CSS for stunning visuals and animations. It combines technical skills with creative UX to deliver a memorable and entertaining web application.
